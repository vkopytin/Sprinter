# Sprinter
Rendering engine for runners

Before start with this repo you need to install:
```
$ npm install -g typescript webpack

```
npm install typings --global
npm install -g tslint

After installation please link global TypeScript to your project

```
$ npm link typescript
```

for code editing we are using visual studio code (it's free)
some extensions you could found useful
* vscode-todo-parser - to parse TODO's from code files
* tslint - for obvious reason :)
